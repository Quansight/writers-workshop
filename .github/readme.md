# github practices for the workshops

we've provided some github templates for [issues] and [pull requests][pulls] that should help contribute to the workshop.
please submit a new template if you think one is missing.

## how [discussions] work

we use [discussions] for open ended issues that don't close, for example classes and discussions

## how [submitting issues works][issues]

we use [issues] for tasks that can be triaged and resolved eventually, (eg new ideas, publishing improvments, submitting a document)

## how publishing works

we aren't saying everything passes, we have standards!

1. 🥚 the issue is triaged by an editor within the first __24 business hours__
  1. 📛 issue is tagged
  2. 🧐 reviewers manual assigned
  * ⏲️ countdown begins  7️⃣5️⃣3️⃣1️⃣
    * ❓ reviewers assign themselves
    * 🤔 review required
    * ♻️ restart countdown
  * 🏁 no review required after 7️⃣5️⃣3️⃣1️⃣ days
  * 🏆  close and accept
  4. 🟢 tests pass
  5. 🌝 there are sufficient reviews, or reactions
