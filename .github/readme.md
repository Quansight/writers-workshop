# 🚀 blast off publishing

in _blast of publishing_, content is submitted with the intent of being accepted, the more reviews and feedback, the sooner it is publishing.
this is a completely open source approach to managing content while mitigating futhercoming technical debts. 

when we write together, we read together, and publish together. it is important to feedback to a work that you share attribution with.
