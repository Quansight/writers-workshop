# quansight writers workshop

the quansight writers workshop is a creative program focused on learning how to write literate programs. we will learn to strive for literary excellence in all of our works like blogs, white papers, code, and documentation. we'll supplement language and design with code to acheive interesting, eccentric stories.

the cirriculum is designed for all open source participants, one can get by mostly on markdown language alone. we explore writing for ourselves, others, and, the hardest of all, ourselves.

## grading

we have a hippy grade system where you grade yourselves. the classes worked will be collected into a single document that represents the groups collective works. you will be able to measure yourselves collectively, and be wildly impressed with the outcomes.
